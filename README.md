# SkipBo
A Web App for playing the game of Skip-Bo. Features include: Real-Time Multiplayer, AI Players, &amp; a Cheats menu for testing. Unfortunately, the game is not actively hosted, but can be run and tested in Eclipse. Still needs some polishing, mainly on the front-end and some concurrency on the server side, but is one of my largest projects to date, so I'm proud of her.
